## Settings

We try to make functionality as flexible and configurable as possible.
Unfortunately this is often at the expense of ease of use.
Many areas have context (right click) menus exposing additional features and settings.

~We are saving up for a signing certificate and associated costs but it is very expensive.~ it's unlikely this will ever happen but I try to update the windows store app regularly which seems to address AV false positives to some extent.
